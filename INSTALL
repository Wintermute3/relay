Starting with an unconfigured Raspberry Pi, do the following:

    - assure that WiFi is connected to the Internet
    - open a command prompt
    - assure git is installed:
        sudo apt install git
    - change into the 'pi' user's home directory:
        cd

If the 'relay' directory already exists in the 'pi' home directory,
then update it like this:

    - change into the 'relay' directory:
        cd relay
    - update the contents to the latest version:
        git pull

Otherwise, create it like this:

    - clone the wintermute3/relay project from github:
        git clone https://github.com/Wintermute3/relay.git
    - change into the relay directory:
        cd relay

Now run the installation script (it doesn't hurt to do so more
than once):

    - run the install script:
        ./install.sh

After the script finishes, you should be good to go inserting 'relay'
commands in the key bindings configuration file.  if you run it again
it should display a 'success' message to confirm all went well.
