Starting with an unconfigured Raspberry Pi, do the following:

    - assure that WiFi is connected to the Internet

    - open a command prompt

    - assure git is installed:

        sudo apt install git

    - change into the 'pi' user's home directory:

        cd

    - clone the wintermute3/relay project from github:

        git clone https://github.com/Wintermute3/relay.git

    - change into the relay directory:

        cd relay

    - run the install script:

        ./install.sh

After the script finishes, you should be good to go inserting 'relay'
commands in the key bindings configuration file.
